I consider this as one of the most elegant and succinct proofs in the mathamtics.

Statement: There are infintely many prime numbers.
======

Proof:
------

Assume that there are finite prime numbers. Let there be $n$ prime number in total. Hence, the complete list of all prime number can be written as:

$$\{ p_1, p_2, p_3, \cdots, p_n \}\,.\tag{1}$$

Now conisder number $r$ which is the product of all prime numbers.

$$r = p_1 \times p_2 \times \cdots \times p_n \,.\tag{2}$$

Now consider number $q$ defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
q &= r+1\,,\tag{3.1}\\
&=  (p_1 \times p_2 \times \cdots \times p_n)+1\,.\tag{3.2}
\end{align*}
$$

Since we have list of all prime numbers, stated in \\((1)\\), \\(q\\) cannot be prime, hence it must be divisble by at least two of the numbers from our list. However, which is not true. \\(r\\) is perfectly divisble by all elements from \\((1)\\), but \\(q\\) is not. 

Hence, \\(q\\) must be a prime number.

Hence, our original assumption of there being finite prime numbers is wrong.

Hence, we have proved that there are infintely many prime numbers using contradiction. 

(need improvement)
